# Die #
## A Language For the Aggressive Programmer ##

Die is a language you can use to tell other programmers what you think of them, as well
as make them confused and angry as they try and parse out your code.
It's a simple language, based on the ideas of Brain^%3@.

I don't personally recommend using this language. But you're certainly welcome to do so!
